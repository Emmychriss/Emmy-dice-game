#### The play guide at the top right part needs some finesse touches though...

###### Two players are to roll a dice each, reaching a specified maximum of 100 total points</b> determines the winner . However, if a dice roll of 1 is obtained by any of the players, the current player isswitched to the other player.
###### At any point in the game, any player can decide to hold current score as a game strategy to avoid throwing 1.
###### You can use the new game reset button to have a fresh start of the game from beginning.

##### Your ideas wouldn't be bad on how the player guide can be positioned well :)
